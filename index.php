        Authenticity is a brand new exciting company for talented young authentic dancers aged 11-
        18 to represent London. The aim is to highlight the elite dance talent within London, provide
        performance opportunities that are accessible and affordable as well as nurture a safe and
        creative environment to train and grow within dance.
        For their opening works, dancers are working alongside the Impact Dance creative team to
        create a 15-minute piece of work, which will be performed outdoors at this year’s ‘Dancing
        City’(Greenwich Docklands International Festival) and ‘Imagine Watford’ (Watford Palace
        Theatre) at the end of June/beginning of July 2018.

          <strong>Choreographers:</strong> Rachel Greer, Hakeem Onibudo and Keanu Wilson

          <strong>Name: </strong>Transient
          <br>
          <strong>Duration: </strong>12 minutes
          <br>
          <strong>Description: </strong> Youth are depicted as a fast-paced Society, moving 
          at speed causing them to ‘miss’ details about their environment and the people 
          around them. With an interjection, they are forced to slow down, enabling them to 
          notice their surroundings. Notice leads to observation-observation may lead to focus. 
          Resulting in stillness – this creates a sense of empathy which may reverberate 
          through individuals.
